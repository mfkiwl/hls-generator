<h1 align="center">HLS Generator</h1>

<p align="center">
  A Codex-ready agent skill for structured AMD/Xilinx Vitis HLS workflows.
</p>

HLS Generator turns an AI coding agent into a more disciplined HLS engineering assistant. It provides trigger metadata, procedural instructions, reference material, deterministic runtime helpers, examples, and validation gates for moving from confirmed hardware intent to Vitis-ready HLS artifacts.

This repository is primarily an **agent skill package**. The Python CLI is included as the deterministic execution layer, but the main interface is the skill surface an agent can load and follow.

## Why It Exists

Hardware generation fails when the agent jumps straight from a vague request to code. HLS Generator inserts the missing engineering steps: requirement confirmation, interface contracts, staged planning, test-vector construction, Python reference checks, HLS artifact extraction, and validation evidence.

Use it when an agent needs to work on:

- Vitis HLS C/C++ kernels, headers, and testbenches.
- AXI memory, AXI4-Stream, native scalar, and custom interface contracts.
- `PIPELINE`, `DATAFLOW`, `ARRAY_PARTITION`, `STREAM`, and related pragma decisions.
- HLS configuration, Tcl rendering, report collection, and toolchain readiness.
- Debugging HLS-generated RTL interfaces by tracing issues back to HLS source, pragmas, configuration, or reports.

## Repository Map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SKILL.md` | Agent-facing routing, workflow, constraints, and tool usage rules. |
| `agents/openai.yaml` | UI metadata for skill lists and invocation chips. |
| `runtime/hls_generator/` | Deterministic scaffolding, prompt rendering, extraction, validation, reports, and workflow state. |
| `integration/hls_adapter.py` | Stable host-facing facade for workflow, prompt, and validation calls. |
| `assets/examples/` | Reusable structured HLS specs for stream, memory, dataflow, partition, reshape, fixed-point, and multi-`m_axi` cases. |
| `references/` | Vitis HLS policies, configuration rules, workflow contracts, integration notes, and comment style guidance. |

## Quick Start

Place this repository in a Codex skill search path to use it as an agent skill. For runtime development and local checks:

```powershell
python -m runtime.hls_generator --version
python -m runtime.hls_generator config --path
python -m runtime.hls_generator deps check --json
python -m runtime.hls_generator scaffold --target hls --name vector_scale --out .\reports\hls\spec.json
python -m runtime.hls_generator prompt --target hls --spec .\reports\hls\spec.json --out .\reports\hls\prompt.md --comment-language en
```

On first use, dependency checks block missing required or recommended Codex skills. Ask the user before running `python -m runtime.hls_generator deps install --all`, then restart Codex so newly installed skill metadata is loaded.

Static validation without external AMD/Xilinx tools:

```powershell
python -m runtime.hls_generator validate --target hls --spec .\reports\hls\spec.json --path .\reports\hls\generated --readiness static --no-external
```

External validation requires a real Vitis HLS installation. This project does not claim Vitis acceptance unless `vitis-run` or `vitis_hls` actually runs.

## Integration API

```python
from integration.hls_adapter import (
    render_hls_prompt,
    run_hls_workflow,
    validate_hls_artifacts,
)
```

- `run_hls_workflow(...)`: run or resume the staged HLS workflow.
- `render_hls_prompt(...)`: render prompts when a host owns the model call.
- `validate_hls_artifacts(...)`: validate generated artifacts before downstream use.

## Scope

HLS Generator is intentionally narrow:

- It generates Vitis HLS C/C++ artifacts, not handwritten RTL.
- Python models and vectors are validation intermediates, not hardware deliverables.
- HLS-generated RTL issues are in scope only when they trace back to HLS code, pragmas, configuration, or reports.
- Local secrets, proprietary hardware designs, generated caches, and private remote-server details should stay out of the repository.
