# Erie HLS Generator

Use this skill for local AMD-Xilinx/Vitis HLS C/C++ kernel generation. The bundled runtime lives in `runtime/hls_generator`, and the stable local facade is `integration/hls_adapter.py`.

## Workflow

1. On first trigger in a Codex session, run `python -m runtime.hls_generator deps check --json` from this skill directory. If it reports `blocked_dependency`, ask the user whether to install the listed dependencies before continuing; do not degrade or continue past missing required or recommended dependencies.
2. Start from a confirmed HLS JSON spec or create one with the scaffold command.
3. Use the facade for local integrations:
   - `run_hls_workflow(...)` for full staged execution or resume.
   - `render_hls_prompt(...)` when a caller owns the model call.
   - `validate_hls_artifacts(...)` before using generated files downstream.
4. Require a confirmed requirement contract before generation: `pipeline_required`, `streamability`, `interface_family`, `interface_profile`, `confirmed_by_user`, and `confirmation_notes`. When throughput targets, numeric strategy, task parallelism, or device portability are in scope, confirm those constraints before code generation.
5. Run the fixed HLS pipeline: `requirements -> codegen_plan -> tests -> python -> hls -> report_review -> remote_acceptance`.
6. Keep final hardware-facing artifacts limited to HLS C/C++ headers, sources, C++ testbenches, `.cfg` files, and reports. Python models and vectors are validation intermediates.
7. Validate with AMD-Xilinx tooling. The validator prefers `vitis-run` and falls back to `vitis_hls`; missing local tools block with a remote-server request so the caller can ask the user to choose an `erie-remote-ssh` server with Vitis available.
8. For Vitis development, simulation, cosim, and debug guidance, follow `runtime_config.json` skill routing: prefer `vitis-developer` when installed, otherwise fall back to `vitis-hls-synthesis`.

## Local Commands

Run the bundled smoke validator from this skill directory:

```powershell
python .\smoke\run_smoke.py
```

Use the runtime CLI:

```powershell
python -m runtime.hls_generator config --path
python -m runtime.hls_generator deps check --json
python -m runtime.hls_generator deps request --out .\reports\skill_dependency_request.json
python -m runtime.hls_generator scaffold --target hls --name vector_scale --out .\reports\hls\spec.json
python -m runtime.hls_generator prompt --target hls --spec .\reports\hls\spec.json --out .\reports\hls\prompt.md
python -m runtime.hls_generator validate --target hls --spec .\reports\hls\spec.json --path .\reports\hls\generated --readiness static --no-external
```

When local `vitis-run`/`vitis_hls` is missing, inspect the workflow's `remote_toolchain_request.json`, ask the user to choose a configured `erie-remote-ssh` server, then use the remote acceptance helper:

```powershell
python .\scripts\remote_vitis_acceptance.py --mode link --server <erie-server>
python .\scripts\remote_vitis_acceptance.py --mode vitis --server <erie-server> --profile <configured-profile> --readiness <execute|implement|cosim>
```

Remote Vitis acceptance refreshes erie software scan data. If multiple Vitis
versions are detected and no version has been saved for that server in
`~/.hls-generator/config.json`, ask the user to choose a version and rerun with
`--vitis-version <version>`.

If no remote Vitis profile has been configured and no previously saved remote
selection provides the required tool path, expected tool, and target part,
stop and ask the user to configure those values before continuing. Do not guess
or fall back to a package default path.

Vitis remote acceptance keeps the remote validation directory by default and reports
`remote_dir` relative to the selected erie server workdir. Pass
`--cleanup-remote` only when the user explicitly wants that remote project
deleted after a successful run.

## Reference Loading

- Load `references/integration.md` when wiring the local facade into another script.
- Load `references/workflow-contracts.md` when handling run directories, statuses, resume behavior, or traces.
- Load `references/configuration.md` before changing generated roots, protected paths, Vitis tool commands, or timeouts.
- Load `references/vitis-hls-2024-2-script-guide.md` before changing Vitis HLS `.cfg` parsing, Tcl rendering, pragma rules, report handling, or compatibility checks.
- Load `references/hls-optimization-patterns.md` before changing optimization examples, prompt pragma policy, report-driven tuning rules, or reusable HLS pattern guidance.
- Load `references/hls-report-driven-optimization.md` before changing performance-goal framing, synthesis-report interpretation, or optimization-step sequencing.
- Load `references/hls-modeling-strategy.md` before changing loop-bound handling, numeric-type guidance, pointer modeling, template/vector usage, or conditional pragma policy.
- Load `references/hls-task-parallel-strategy.md` before changing task-level parallelism guidance, channel semantics, restart behavior, or stream/dataflow positioning.
- Load `references/hls-device-migration-strategy.md` before changing target-part migration guidance, QoR comparison rules, or floating-point/fixed-point portability advice.
- Load `references/hls-library-policy.md` before changing HLS include choices, advanced HLS library usage, or generated library examples.
- Load `references/hls-comment-style.md` before changing generated C/C++ comment language, comment coverage, or comment validation rules.
- Use `assets/examples/` for minimal HLS memory, stream, partition, dataflow, multi-`m_axi`, and numeric-strategy specs.

## Boundaries

- Do not generate handwritten Verilog or SystemVerilog.
- HLS-generated RTL/Verilog interface, export, cosim, and debug issues are in scope when they trace back to Vitis HLS code, pragmas, configuration, or reports.
- Pure handwritten Verilog/SystemVerilog debug is not led by this skill; use vivado-debug, vivado-sim, vivado-analysis, or RTL-focused skills for those tasks.
- Do not use local non-HLS hardware tools as validation substitutes.
- Do not modify files outside this skill directory.
- Keep path and Vitis-tool policy in `runtime/hls_generator/runtime_config.json`; update `references/configuration.md` when the policy changes.
- Keep skill dependencies in `runtime/hls_generator/runtime_config.json`; missing required or recommended dependencies are blocking. Install only after the user confirms, then restart Codex so new skill metadata is loaded.
- If `vitis-developer` is installed, dependency installation must not install `vitis-hls-synthesis` from FPGA-Agent-Skills; the remaining Vivado skills are still required.
- Use `erie-remote-ssh` for remote SSH checks; do not copy server-list details into this skill.
- If local Vitis tools are unavailable, prefer requesting a remote erie server over weakening validation or substituting non-HLS tools. Discover and present erie server choices before connecting.
- When comment language is `auto`, use the user's `~/.hls-generator/config.json`; if it has no saved language, ask the user to choose English (`en`) or Chinese (`zh`) before generation.
- Do not claim Vitis validation passed unless `vitis-run` or `vitis_hls` actually ran.
